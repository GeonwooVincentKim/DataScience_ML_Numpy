Key Components of DL
- The Data that the model can learn from
- The model how to transform the data
- The loss function that quantifies the badness of the model
- The algorithm to adjust the parameters to minimize the loss


Data
- Data depend on the type of the problem to solve
  = Classification
  = Semantic Segmentation (Dense Classification)
  = Detection
  = Post Estimiation
  = Visual QnA


Model
- AlexNet
- GoogleNet
- ResNet
- DenseNet
- LSTM
- Deep AutoEncoders
- GAN


LOSS
- The loss function is a proxy of what we want to achieve
  = Regression Task -> MSE
  = Classification Task -> CE
  = Probabilistic Task -> MLE -> MSE


Optimization Algorithm
- Dropout
- Early Stopping
- K-fold validation
- Weight decay
- Batch normalization
- MixUp
- Ensemble
- Bayesian Optimization
